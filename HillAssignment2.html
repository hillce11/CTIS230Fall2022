<body><h1>Senior Art Portfolio 2020</h1><h2><strong>1. Modern 1980s Couch</strong></h2>
<p>This piece was created as a visual representation of my emotion. This work started as a wash of happy colors and symbols, however, changed as time progressed. I began to feel stress, and other emotions over the duration of this work, and began to add them to the piece. This work portrays several emotions, the most prominent being the feeling of excessive stress, implemented through my use of layering and shapes.
I brought this piece to National Portfolio Day in 2017, and my reviewer stated that it resembled a "1980s Couch," which is where I derived a part of my title from. I feel as though this work represents a "Modern 1980s Couch" by my uncomfortable yet pleasing use of texture and pattern, along with shape and line. Patterns on couches in the 80's were more traditional and vintage, while this piece requires your eye to travel and assess it in its entirety.</p>
<h2><strong>2. No Days Off</strong></h2>
<p>No matter the circumstance, individuals are designed to do activities on a day to day basis. Whether it's brushing your teeth, obeying traffic laws, paying bills, or making dinner, we must get through difficult situations because time never stops. This work shows that even on the gloomiest of days, life continues. This piece was my first in watercolor, and I loved the process of layering colors and leaving parts of the paper raw and exposed to capture true highlights. I tied both color and highlights together in the rain droplets on the window of the foreground, for each droplet of water contains a reflection of light, but also picks up the additional colors of what's behind them.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Scuba Steve</strong></h2>
<p>This vibrant mixed media piece was inspired by a tattoo I designed for my brother. He simply wanted a black and white drawing of a vintage scuba diver, whose arm was raised while motioning, "Rock On". I believed I could create this piece in color, and in an artistic way, so I did. I painted his suit with rusty browns and a few gold tones, added black micron pen over top to shade his figure, and cut seaweed-shapes from magazines to consume him in the ocean's grass. This piece was fun to create and I enjoyed the process of collage.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Self Portrait</strong></h2>
<p>One of the hardest people to capture as an artist is yourself. Recreating your own features exactly as they are can be very challenging, especially when the artist is not fully comfortable with his or her appearance. I successfully captured myself through my use of color and shape. This original photo is a part of my senior pictures, and I wanted to create an image that displayed my love for nature, colors, and thrift store dresses. I took a more surrealist approach in my painting under each of my arms. I had a great time experimenting with styles of painting, but also improving my painting skills. My favorite part of this piece is the white, five dollar dress that I recreated using various shades of blue and white. Though the dress is white in person, the tints, shadows, and lighting all affected what color the dress appeared to be, and I feel that my craftsmanship in the dress portrays that perfectly.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Koi Bois</strong></h2>
<p>This was one of my first colored pencil pieces. Though I have improved my skills and have created more quality colored pencil works, I still enjoy this piece of the four koi fish. They appear tightly packed in this space as they are overlapping one another. The reflections take more of an abstract approach, as they are the negative spaces in this work. Each fish is dressed in different colored scales, which adds diversity and distinction to this piece.</p>
<h2><strong>6. High School</strong></h2>
<p>This is one of my most recent pieces. The upside-down jester is performing in front of an enormous crowd of people, while he masks his true emotions with a fake smile. As I am currently a senior in high school, it has come to my attention that my fellow classmates and peers resemble my illustration of "High School". Individuals are always performing for the people around them, not allowing others to see the entirety and truth of themselves. They want their peers to see only the good, and to mask their imperfections and insecurities. I stressed this concept by implementing strong colors to attract your eye to the subject matter. The jester is displayed with a variety of vibrant colors, and causes you to study all of his features; his color also makes him superior to the background. However, it is still apparent that he is performing for an audience, which is a key part of my concept.</p>
<h2><strong>7. The Bennett Boys</strong></h2>
<p>This picture is of my boyfriend and his two little brothers in 2005. His family cherishes photography more than anything. Capturing memories is something my boyfriend's mother does often, and has been doing it since each boy was born. This is my boyfriend's father's favorite image of the boys, for he believes it captures them in their states of genuine happiness. I recreated this picture as a challenge, however, I fell in love with the result.</p>
<h2><strong>8. Observant</strong></h2>
<p>This acrylic piece is a recreation of a photograph my mother took in my backyard. On this day, my mother called me down from my room and told me to come see something in the backyard. I opened my back door, and immediately noticed this gigantic, beautiful owl watching over its surroundings. He remained still, and continued to watch us with his intimidating stare. I captured the dimension in its face by layering colors and implementing the shapes of its puny feathers. The owl's body was loosely interpreted with organic paint strokes, and ties in the pops of orange from the leaves in the foreground.</p>
<h2><strong>9. Serenity</strong></h2>
<p>This piece was inspired by the infamous Bob Ross. I created this colorful work in the back room of my grandmother's house. I titled this painting, "Serenity" due to the image's calming persona, but also because this is the feeling that consumes me when I am around my grandmother. She, herself, is an artist and has always promoted and encouraged me to create my best works of art. This work embodies the calming presence and personality of my grandmother, and is where I believe she will go in her afterlife.</p>
<h2><strong>10. Scuba Steve II</strong></h2>
<p>This work was inspired by my original work, "Scuba Steve", however, I wanted this piece to have more depth and meaning. This piece displays my idea that mankind does not have to obtain knowledge of everything. It is okay for there to be an unknown, and one of the most "unknown" places on this earth is our oceans. This piece shows the scuba diver being restrained by a massive jellyfish; this is reminiscent of a puppet on strings. This concept visually captures mother nature and her strength, and how humans should keep to themselves.</p>
<h2><strong>11. Capturing The Moment</strong></h2>
<p>This is an image of my boyfriend. Having this human in my life has been an absolute joy, and he has pushed me to do my best in art and my other extracurricular activities. I captured him by using my 132 pack of colored pencils. I enjoyed pushing the shadows in fabrics like those in his hat and in his shirt. He is distinctively in the foreground, though I made sure the middleground and background both received the attention and detail that they deserved.</p>
<h2><strong>12. Journey</strong></h2>
<p>I titled this work, "Journey" as it represents the steps I have taken to get where I am today. The vibrant colors speak for the various challenges and emotions I have faced along the way. In this piece, the foreground dances with the background, both physically and metaphorically, with the exception of the pale yellow foot that is outlined and stands alone. The sole up foot embodies where I stand today, as I look forward to the next steps in my life.</p>
<h2><strong>13. Childhood Memories</strong></h2>
<p>This mug was created to remind me of one of the happiest places on earth: Outer Banks, North Carolina. I have visited this beach since my childhood, and have accumulated many pleasant memories from each vacation that I have spent there. Though you can't enjoy a day in the sun, storms at the beach are one of the most comforting things. I wanted to feel that comfort at home, so I created a mug, pressed with shells and carved with waves, to remind me of the feelings I acquired while I was in a beach storm.</p>
<h2><strong>14. Liberated</strong></h2>
<p>When I was born, my hips were dislocated. I had surgery to have them repaired, resulting in a hard cast from my waist to my ankles for nine months. Though the doctors were concerned that I would face problems later in my life, I grew into a well rounded soccer player. This conceptual piece represents a sense of freedom. I was restricted with poor hips at a young age, which is the symbolic meaning behind the human hip bone. I placed flowers around the human skeletal figure, to represent my growth and maturity as I have aged. Lastly, I stripped my soccer cleats of their laces and draped them over the hip bone, to portray how soccer essentially tied my life together. I stressed high contrast in this piece, and paid attention to every detail, as I believe I owe it to myself to display how far I have come as both an artist, and individual.</p></body></head></html>
